##### Poetry  in Typora (two spaces and Enter in the end of each line)

Her memory was a mine: she knew by heart  
  All Calderon and greater part of Lope,  
So that if any actor miss’d his part  
  She could have served him for the prompter’s copy;  
For her Feinagle’s were an useless art,  
  And he himself obliged to shut up shop—he  
Could never make a memory so fine as  
  That which adorn’d the brain of Donna Inez.

Her favourite science was the mathematical,  
 Her noblest virtue was her magnanimity,  
Her wit (she sometimes tried at wit) was Attic all,  
  Her serious sayings darken’d to sublimity;  
In short, in all things she was fairly what I call  
  A prodigy—her morning dress was dimity,  
Her evening silk, or, in the summer, muslin,  
  And other stuffs, with which I won’t stay puzzling.
